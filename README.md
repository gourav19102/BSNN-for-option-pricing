# BSNN-for-option-pricing
The goal of this project is to create and train a neural network model that can imitate and generate the same outcomes as the famous black Scholes model for option pricing.

# DATASET :
created a dataset of apporximately 1 million examples by pricing a call option using the 
[Black scholes formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model) over a range of possible parameter like strike price,time to maturity,moneyness,interest rate,asset price.this dataset we created for trainign our neural network.
